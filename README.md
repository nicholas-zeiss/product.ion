Thesis project for MKS42 group YakkityYaks
---
We, the united YakkityYak Corporations, hereby declare the following:
* Our premiere product for Q3 shall be a multi-faceted financing platform aimed at optimizing data presentations for Television and Web based finance reports.
* Our product shall, specifically, be a budgeting program designed for producers and executive producers of TV and web production companies to organize and view their expenses.
* We fully expect and intend to "make waves" on the worldwide tech scene.

The YakkityYaks will accomplish these declarations using a style equivalant to that of fellow corporate leader AirBnB, who's goals align with ours.
Please direct any and all questions to the YakkityYak Slack
*Signed:*
Tim Clark (product owner);
